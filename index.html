<body>
	The vision aspect of the project was implemented by using Python with OpenCV. 
	Image classification was accomplished by using a pretrained machine learning model called MobileNet. 
	The MobileNet model leveraged the ideal balance between accuracy and performance. 
	Once the vision module identified an bottle object classification, it would perform a search around the surrounding 
	bounding box in order to search for a QR code. It would search for a QR code to determine what kind of bottle it was.
